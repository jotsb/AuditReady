# Performance Phase 2 - Testing Guide

**Status:** Implementation Complete
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Optimizations Implemented:** Lazy Loading, Progressive Image Loading, Bundle Splitting

---

## Phase 2 Optimizations Summary

### 2.1 Lazy Loading for Pages ✅
**Implementation:**
- All pages now use React.lazy() for code splitting
- Suspense boundaries with LoadingSpinner fallback
- Pages load only when needed, reducing initial bundle size

**Expected Impact:**
- Initial bundle size: 40-50% smaller
- Faster initial page load (Time to Interactive)
- Better caching for individual page chunks

### 2.2 Progressive Image Loading ✅
**Implementation:**
- Enhanced skeleton loading with shimmer animation
- Smooth fade-in effect when images load
- Better visual feedback during loading states

**Expected Impact:**
- Improved perceived performance
- No layout shift during image loading
- Better user experience on slow connections

### 2.3 Bundle Splitting ✅
**Implementation:**
- Manual chunks for major vendors:
  - `react-vendor`: React core (react, react-dom)
  - `supabase-vendor`: Supabase client
  - `tanstack-vendor`: React Query
  - `pdf-vendor`: PDF generation (jspdf, jspdf-autotable)
  - `pdfjs-vendor`: PDF viewing (pdfjs-dist)
  - `utils-vendor`: Utilities (lucide-react, dompurify, qrcode)

**Expected Impact:**
- Better browser caching (vendors change less frequently)
- Parallel chunk loading with HTTP/2
- Faster updates (only changed chunks redownload)

## Testing Guide

### Pre-Testing Setup

1. **Build the production bundle:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Serve the production build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. **Open Chrome DevTools:**
   - Press F12 or right-click → Inspect
   - Go to Network tab
   - Enable "Disable cache" for accurate testing
   - Throttle to "Slow 3G" or "Fast 3G" for realistic testing

---

## Test 1: Lazy Loading Verification

### Goal
Verify that pages are loaded on-demand and not in the initial bundle.

### Steps

1. **Clear browser cache** (important!)
   - Chrome DevTools → Network tab
   - Right-click → "Clear browser cache"

2. **Reload the login page**
   - Observe the Network tab
   - Look for files being loaded

3. **Expected Results:**
   - Initial load should be < 300 KB (down from 1.7 MB)
   - You should see files like:
     - `index-[hash].js` (main bundle)
     - `react-vendor-[hash].js` (React)
     - `supabase-vendor-[hash].js` (Supabase)
   - **You should NOT see** dashboard, receipts, or other page chunks yet

4. **Navigate to Dashboard**
   - Log in
   - Watch Network tab for new chunks loading
   - Expected: `DashboardPage-[hash].js` loads now

5. **Navigate to Receipts**
   - Click "Receipts" in sidebar
   - Expected: `ReceiptsPage-[hash].js` loads now

6. **Navigate to Reports**
   - Click "Reports"
   - Expected: `ReportsPage-[hash].js` loads now

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Each page loads its own chunk on first visit
- ✅ Subsequent visits to the same page use cached chunks (0ms load time)
- ✅ Initial bundle is 40-50% smaller
- ✅ Pages load with LoadingSpinner fallback

---

## Test 2: Bundle Splitting Verification

### Goal
Verify that vendors are split into separate, cacheable chunks.

### Steps

1. **Build and inspect chunks:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ls -lh dist/assets/
   ```

2. **Expected chunks in dist/assets/:**
   ```
   react-vendor-[hash].js        (~150 KB)
   supabase-vendor-[hash].js     (~200 KB)
   tanstack-vendor-[hash].js     (~50 KB)
   pdf-vendor-[hash].js          (~450 KB)
   pdfjs-vendor-[hash].js        (~1 MB - worker)
   utils-vendor-[hash].js        (~150 KB)
   DashboardPage-[hash].js       (~50-100 KB)
   ReceiptsPage-[hash].js        (~80-120 KB)
   ... (other page chunks)
   ```

3. **Test caching behavior:**
   - Load the app in browser
   - Wait for full load
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Check Network tab → Size column
   - **Expected:** Vendor chunks show "(disk cache)" or "(memory cache)"

4. **Simulate code update:**
   - Make a small change to DashboardPage.tsx (e.g., add a comment)
   - Rebuild: `npm run build`
   - Compare old vs new dist/assets/ folder
   - **Expected:**
     - DashboardPage-[hash].js has NEW hash
     - react-vendor, supabase-vendor, etc. have SAME hash
     - Only changed chunks need to be redownloaded

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Vendor chunks are separate files
- ✅ Vendor chunks are cached across page reloads
- ✅ Vendor chunks don't change when app code changes
- ✅ Page chunks change independently

## Test 3: Progressive Image Loading

### Goal
Verify skeleton loading states and smooth image transitions.

### Steps

1. **Throttle network:**
   - Chrome DevTools → Network tab
   - Throttling dropdown → "Slow 3G"

2. **Navigate to Receipts page:**
   - Log in
   - Go to Receipts
   - Watch thumbnails load

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - **Before load:** Shimmer skeleton animation (gradient slides left to right)
   - **During load:** Smooth transition from skeleton to image
   - **After load:** Image displayed, no layout shift
   - **On error:** Fallback icon (ImageIcon or FileText)

4. **Test IntersectionObserver:**
   - Scroll down slowly on Receipts page
   - **Expected:** Thumbnails load as they enter viewport (not all at once)
   - Check Console → Network tab
   - **Expected:** Thumbnail requests are staggered, not simultaneous

5. **Test error handling:**
   - Delete a receipt image from Supabase Storage
   - Reload receipts page
   - **Expected:** Missing image shows fallback icon, no broken image or error

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Skeleton animation is smooth and visible
- ✅ Images load progressively as you scroll
- ✅ No layout shift when images load
- ✅ Error states handled gracefully
- ✅ Loading states are visible on slow connections

## Test 4: Initial Load Performance

### Goal
Measure actual performance improvements from Phase 1 + Phase 2.

### Steps

1. **Lighthouse Audit (Before/After comparison):**
   ```bash
   # Open app in Incognito mode (to avoid extensions)
   # Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse tab
   # Categories: Performance
   # Device: Mobile
   # Click "Analyze page load"
   ```

2. **Expected Lighthouse scores:**
   - **Performance:** 80-90+ (up from ~70)
   - **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** < 1.5s
   - **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** < 2.5s
   - **Time to Interactive (TTI):** < 3.5s
   - **Total Blocking Time (TBT):** < 300ms
   - **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** < 0.1

3. **Manual timing measurements:**
   - Clear cache
   - Open DevTools → Network tab
   - Reload page
   - Record these metrics from Network tab:
     - **DOMContentLoaded:** Time when HTML is parsed
     - **Load:** Time when all resources loaded
     - **Finish:** Time when last request finished
     - **Transferred:** Total data transferred

4. **Compare before/after:**
   ```
   BEFORE (Phase 0):
   - Initial bundle: ~1.7 MB uncompressed (~460 KB gzipped)
   - DOMContentLoaded: ~2.5s (3G)
   - Load: ~8s (3G)

   AFTER (Phase 1 + 2):
   - Initial bundle: ~800 KB uncompressed (~250 KB gzipped) [-47%]
   - DOMContentLoaded: ~1.2s (3G) [-52%]
   - Load: ~4s (3G) [-50%]
   ```

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Initial bundle size reduced by 40-50%
- ✅ Time to Interactive improved by 40-50%
- ✅ Lighthouse Performance score 80+
- ✅ All Core Web Vitals in "Good" range

## Performance Monitoring

### Browser DevTools Performance Tab

1. **Record a session:**
   - Open DevTools → Performance tab
   - Click Record
   - Perform common actions (navigate, search, upload)
   - Stop recording

2. **Analyze the flamegraph:**
   - Look for long tasks (> 50ms)
   - Check for unnecessary re-renders
   - Verify lazy loading works
   - Check for memory leaks

3. **Key metrics to watch:**
   - **Scripting time:** Should be minimal during idle
   - **Rendering time:** Should be < 16ms per frame (60fps)
   - **Loading time:** Should be fast with proper caching

### React DevTools Profiler

1. **Install React DevTools extension**

2. **Profile a page:**
   - Open React DevTools → Profiler tab
   - Click Record
   - Navigate between pages
   - Stop recording

3. **Check for:**
   - Unnecessary component re-renders (should be minimal with React.memo)
   - Slow components (> 16ms render time)
   - Wasted renders (components that render but don't change)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Chunks fail to load (404 errors)

**Symptoms:**
- Console errors like "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module"
- Blank pages after navigation

**Causes:**
- Old service worker caching old chunk names
- Browser cached old index.html with outdated chunk references

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Clear browser cache completely
# Or hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

# Rebuild with cache busting:
rm -rf dist/
npm run build
```

### Issue: Images not loading

**Symptoms:**
- Skeleton stays visible forever
- No images display

**Causes:**
- Supabase storage permissions
- Network issues
- Invalid signed URLs

**Solutions:**
1. Check Supabase Storage RLS policies
2. Check browser Console for errors
3. Verify thumbnail_path in database
4. Test signed URL generation manually

### Issue: Suspense fallback shows too briefly (flashing)

**Symptoms:**
- Quick flash of loading spinner
- Jarring user experience

**Solutions:**
```typescript
// Add minimum delay to Suspense fallback
const [showFallback, setShowFallback] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => setShowFallback(true), 200);
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, []);

// Only show spinner after 200ms delay
{showFallback && <LoadingSpinner />}
```

### Issue: Bundle size increased instead of decreased

**Symptoms:**
- Total bundle size is larger after optimization

**Causes:**
- Vite creating duplicate chunks
- Dependencies included in multiple chunks

**Solutions:**
1. Analyze bundle with visualizer:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev rollup-plugin-visualizer
   ```

2. Update vite.config.ts:
   ```typescript
   import { visualizer } from 'rollup-plugin-visualizer';

   plugins: [
     react(),
     visualizer({ open: true, gzipSize: true })
   ]
   ```

3. Rebuild and check stats.html
