## Phase 1: Quick Wins (START HERE) 🎯

**Why Start Here:** Maximum impact with minimal risk and effort

### Tasks:
1. **Database Indexes** (2h) - Add 7 critical indexes to speed up queries
2. **Debounced Search** (2h) - Stop filtering on every keystroke
3. **React.memo** (1h) - Prevent unnecessary re-renders of thumbnails
4. **Fix N+1 Query** (3h) - Single query instead of 20+ for thumbnails
5. **Lazy Image Loading** (1h) - Add `loading="lazy"` to all images
6. **Request Batching** (2h) - Combine multiple API calls into one

### Quick Wins You'll See:
- ⚡ Database queries 40-50% faster
- ⚡ Search feels instant (no lag)
- ⚡ Smooth scrolling through receipts
- ⚡ Faster initial page load

### Risk Level: **LOW** ✅
All changes are isolated and easily reversible.

---

## Phase 2: Core Optimizations

**After Phase 1 Success:** Tackle these bigger improvements

### Tasks:
1. **React Query** (8h) - Smart caching and data management
2. **Virtual Scrolling** (6h) - Only render visible receipts
3. **Lazy Loading Pages** (4h) - Split code by route
4. **Optimize RLS Policies** (6h) - Faster permission checks
5. **Progressive Images** (4h) - Show blurred preview while loading
6. **Bundle Splitting** (4h) - Separate vendor and app code

### What You'll Get:
- 📦 40-50% smaller initial bundle
- 🖼️ Instant image placeholders
- 📊 Smooth scrolling with 1000+ receipts
- 🔄 Intelligent data caching

### Risk Level: **MEDIUM** ⚠️
Requires more testing but high value.

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations

**For Peak Performance:** Advanced techniques for production

### Tasks:
1. **Service Worker** (16h) - Offline support and caching
2. **Web Workers** (12h) - Process images in background
3. **Cursor Pagination** (8h) - Infinite scroll optimization
4. **Edge Function Optimization** (8h) - Faster serverless functions
5. **Intersection Observers** (6h) - Load content when visible
6. **Draft Auto-Save** (6h) - Never lose form data

### Benefits:
- 🌐 Works offline
- ⚙️ Non-blocking image processing
- 📜 Smooth infinite scroll
- 💾 Auto-save all forms

### Risk Level: **MEDIUM-HIGH** ⚠️⚠️
More complex but industry best practices.

---

## Phase 4: Ongoing Improvements

### Continuous Tasks:
- Performance monitoring (Lighthouse CI)
- Bundle size tracking
- Core Web Vitals monitoring
- A/B testing optimizations
- User feedback collection

---

---

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Always Create a Git Tag Before Starting
```bash
git tag pre-perf-phase-1
git push --tags
```

### 2. Test After Each Task
- Run build: `npm run build`
- Check bundle size
- Test core functionality
- Run Lighthouse audit

### 3. Document Everything
- Update `/documentation/PERFORMANCE_TODO.md` checkboxes
- Note actual time vs estimated
- Document any issues or deviations
- Record performance metrics

### 4. Rollback Plan Ready
```bash
# If something breaks:
git revert <commit-hash>
npm run build
# Deploy previous version
```

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Before Each Phase:
1. ✅ Baseline performance metrics recorded
2. ✅ Full test suite passing
3. ✅ Git tag created
4. ✅ Team notified of work starting

### During Implementation:
1. ✅ One task at a time
2. ✅ Test immediately after each change
3. ✅ Build succeeds without errors
4. ✅ No functionality broken

### After Each Phase:
1. ✅ Performance improved (measured)
2. ✅ No bugs introduced (tested)
3. ✅ Team review completed
4. ✅ Documentation updated

## Critical Watch-Outs

### Security
- ❗ RLS policies still enforce access control
- ❗ No sensitive data in browser cache
- ❗ Authentication works after all changes

### Functionality
- ❗ Multi-page receipts work correctly
- ❗ Bulk operations (select, delete, categorize)
- ❗ File uploads and processing
- ❗ PDF/CSV exports work

### User Experience
- ❗ No layout shifts during loading
- ❗ Loading states for all operations
- ❗ Error messages clear and helpful
- ❗ Forms don't lose data

---

## Getting Started

### Right Now:
1. ✅ Read this document
2. ✅ Review `/documentation/PERFORMANCE_TODO.md`
3. ✅ Decide: Start Phase 1? When?

### To Begin Phase 1:
1. Create git tag: `git tag pre-perf-phase-1`
2. Open `/documentation/PERFORMANCE_TODO.md`
3. Start with Task 1.1: Database Indexes
4. Check off tasks as you complete them
5. Test thoroughly
6. Move to next task

---

## Questions to Ask Before Starting

1. **Do we have time?** Phase 1 = 11 hours over 1-2 days
2. **Are tests passing?** Need a stable baseline
3. **Can we rollback?** Ensure deployment process allows this
4. **Who will test?** Need QA or user testing after changes
5. **When to deploy?** Not during peak usage times

---

## Expected Timeline

### Conservative (Safe Pace):
- **Week 1:** Phase 1 (2 days) + testing (3 days)
- **Week 2-3:** Phase 2 (5 days) + testing (5 days)
- **Week 4-5:** Phase 3 (8 days) + testing (2 days)
- **Ongoing:** Phase 4 monitoring

### Aggressive (Fast Pace):
- **Week 1:** Phase 1 complete
- **Week 2:** Phase 2 complete
- **Week 3:** Phase 3 complete
- **Week 4+:** Phase 4 monitoring

### Recommended: **Conservative pace with thorough testing**
