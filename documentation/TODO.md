   - Soft delete on user deletion (sets timestamp instead of removing record)
   - Bulk soft delete support (maintains same UX)
   - Receipt images preserved in storage
   - Automatic filtering via RLS policies (deleted receipts invisible to normal queries)
   - Database: Two new columns with indexes for efficient filtering
   - Migrations: `add_soft_delete_to_receipts.sql`, `fix_soft_delete_audit_trigger.sql`

2. **Admin Deleted Receipts Management**: Complete admin interface
