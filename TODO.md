## Known Issues & Notes

### Current Known Issues
1. ✅ ~~Settings page shows placeholder buttons with no functionality~~ - Fixed
2. ✅ ~~Dashboard "View receipt" only logs to console~~ - Fixed (2025-10-07)
3. ✅ ~~Date timezone conversion causing unintended date changes in audit logs~~ - Fixed (2025-10-07)
4. ✅ ~~WebP image uploads failing due to MIME type restrictions~~ - Fixed (2025-10-07)
5. ✅ ~~No pagination causes performance issues with many receipts~~ - Fixed (2025-10-07)
6. ✅ ~~Page refresh redirects to dashboard instead of staying on current page~~ - Fixed (2025-10-08)
7. Bundle size is large (~969KB) - needs optimization
8. MFA database fields exist but no UI implementation
9. Team management UI exists but backend integration incomplete
10. Approval workflow database exists but no UI implementation

### Performance Benchmarks
- Target: First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Target: Time to Interactive < 3.5s
- Target: Receipt upload + extraction < 10s
- Target: Dashboard load < 2s

### Security Standards
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- SOC 2 Type II (future consideration)
- GDPR compliance
- PCI DSS Level 4 (if processing payments)

### Architecture Notes
- Built with React 18 + TypeScript
- Supabase for backend (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- Edge Functions for OCR/AI processing
- OpenAI GPT-4 Vision for receipt extraction
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data access control
- Comprehensive RBAC system in database
