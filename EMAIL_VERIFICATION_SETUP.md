# Email Verification Setup Guide

## Overview
Email verification has been implemented in the application. Users must verify their email address before they can sign in.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Password Strength Indicator
- Real-time password strength evaluation as users type
- Visual strength meter (Weak, Fair, Good, Strong)
- Helpful suggestions for improving password security
- Common password blocking (blocks passwords like "password123", "qwerty", etc.)

### 2. Email Verification Flow
- Users receive a verification email after signup
- Clear "Check Your Email" message with next steps
- Login blocked until email is verified
- Helpful error messaging when unverified users try to sign in

### 3. Resend Verification Email
- Built-in resend functionality on the login page
- One-click resend when users can't find their verification email
- Success confirmation when email is resent

## Supabase Configuration Required

To enable email verification in your Supabase project:

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project

### Step 2: Enable Email Confirmation
1. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Email Auth** section
3. Find **Enable email confirmations**
4. Toggle it **ON**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Configure Email Templates (Optional)
1. In the same Authentication settings page
2. Navigate to **Email Templates**
3. Customize the "Confirm signup" template if desired
4. The default template works well, but you can add your branding

### Step 4: Set Redirect URLs
1. Still in Authentication settings
2. Find **Redirect URLs** section
3. Add your application URLs:
   - Development: `http://localhost:5173/**`
   - Production: `https://yourdomain.com/**`
4. These URLs determine where users are redirected after clicking the verification link

### Step 5: Configure Site URL
1. In the same settings page
2. Set **Site URL** to your application's main URL
3. Development: `http://localhost:5173`
4. Production: `https://yourdomain.com`

## Testing Email Verification

### In Development
By default, Supabase sends emails in development. You can:
1. Use real email addresses for testing
2. Check Supabase logs to see email activity
3. Or disable email confirmation for local development (not recommended)

### Disable for Local Development (Optional)
If you need to disable email verification temporarily for development:
1. Go to Authentication → Settings
2. Toggle **Enable email confirmations** to OFF
3. Remember to enable it before going to production!

## User Experience Flow
