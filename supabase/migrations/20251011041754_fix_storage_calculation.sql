  # Fix Storage Calculation Function

  1. Problem
    - Current function calculates LENGTH(file_path) which is just the path string length
    - Doesn't reflect actual file sizes stored in storage.objects
    
  2. Solution
    - Query storage.objects table to get actual file sizes (metadata->>'size')
    - Sum the actual bytes used by receipt images
    - Handle both full images and thumbnails
    
  3. Changes
    - Update calculate_business_storage() to query storage.objects
    - Join receipts -> storage.objects on file paths
    - Sum actual file sizes in bytes
