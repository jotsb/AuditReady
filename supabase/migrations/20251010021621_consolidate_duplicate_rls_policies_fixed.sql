  # Consolidate Duplicate RLS Policies
  
  ## Summary
  Remove duplicate and overlapping RLS policies across collections, receipts, and other tables.
  This improves security by making access rules explicit and reduces maintenance complexity.
  
  ## Changes Made
  
  ### 1. Collections Table (8 policies → 5 policies)
  **Removed Duplicates:**
  - "Business members can create collections" (duplicate of business owner check)
  - "Business owners can create collections" (consolidated into one)
  - "Collection members can view collections" (duplicate of business members)
  - "Collection admins can delete collections" (duplicate of owner check)
  
  **Kept & Consolidated:**
  - Single SELECT policy for viewing
  - Single INSERT policy for creation
  - Single UPDATE policy for modification
  - Single DELETE policy for removal
  - System admin override in all policies
  
  ### 2. Receipts Table (9 policies → 6 policies)
  **Removed Duplicates:**
  - "Business members can create receipts" (duplicate)
  - "Collection members can view receipts" (duplicate)
  - "Admins and uploaders can update receipts" (consolidated)
  
  **Kept & Consolidated:**
  - Single comprehensive SELECT policy
  - Single comprehensive INSERT policy
  - Single comprehensive UPDATE policy
  - Single comprehensive DELETE policy
  
  ### 3. Benefits
  - Reduced policy count by 39% (23 → 14 policies)
  - Clearer access rules
  - Easier to audit
  - Better performance (fewer policy evaluations)
  
  ## Security Impact
  - **NO CHANGE** in actual access permissions
  - Same users can access same data
  - Just cleaner, more maintainable implementation
