## 📝 TRIGGER VERIFICATION

All audit triggers verified and active:

```sql
-- Run this query to verify all triggers:
SELECT
  c.relname AS table_name,
  COUNT(*) AS trigger_count,
  array_agg(t.tgname ORDER BY t.tgname) AS triggers
FROM pg_trigger t
JOIN pg_class c ON t.tgrelid = c.oid
JOIN pg_namespace n ON c.relnamespace = n.oid
WHERE n.nspname = 'public'
  AND NOT t.tgisinternal
  AND t.tgname LIKE 'audit_%'
GROUP BY c.relname
ORDER BY c.relname;
```

**Result: 11 tables with 13 audit triggers (receipts has 3 separate triggers)**

## 💡 BEST PRACTICES FOR FUTURE FEATURES

When adding new features or tables, **ALWAYS**:

1. **Add Audit Triggers Immediately**
   ```sql
   CREATE TRIGGER audit_[table]_changes
     AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON [table]
     FOR EACH ROW
     EXECUTE FUNCTION log_[table]_changes();
   ```

2. **Track These Actions:**
   - ✅ Who performed the action (user_id)
   - ✅ What changed (before/after snapshots)
   - ✅ When it happened (timestamp)
   - ✅ Context details (resource_id, action type)

3. **Use SECURITY DEFINER**
   - Ensures triggers cannot be bypassed
   - Runs with elevated privileges
   - Users cannot disable audit logging

4. **Include in System Logs**
   - Log to `system_logs` table for operational monitoring
   - Use appropriate log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR)
   - Include user context and action details
