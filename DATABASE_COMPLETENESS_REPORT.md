## Issues Found & Resolved

### ❌ Issue: Missing Function in Migrations

**Problem:** The `get_receipts_with_thumbnails` function existed in the database but was not created in any migration file.

**Impact:** Low - Function exists in production, just missing from migrations.

**Resolution:** ✅ **FIXED**
- Created migration: `20251031000000_add_get_receipts_with_thumbnails_function.sql`
- Function now properly documented and versioned
- Includes comprehensive comments and security settings
