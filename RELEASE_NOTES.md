## 📦 Version 0.6.2 - "Multi-Page Receipt Fixes" (2025-10-13)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### **Multi-Page Receipt Upload - Fixed Critical Issues**
Fixed multiple issues preventing multi-page receipt uploads from working correctly.

**Database Constraint Fix**
- **Problem:** Uploads failing with "null value in column 'total_amount' violates not-null constraint"
- **Root Cause:** Child page records were being inserted without `total_amount` field
- **Solution:** Added `total_amount: 0` to child page records (only parent has actual amount)
- **Additional Fix:** Added validation to ensure parent record always has valid numeric amount

**Thumbnail Display Fix**
- **Problem:** Thumbnails showing as broken images in receipt details page
- **Root Cause:** Thumbnails trying to use public storage URLs instead of signed URLs
- **Solution:** Generate signed URLs for all thumbnails when loading multi-page receipts
- **Technical Details:**
  - Created signed URLs with 1-hour expiration for security
  - Updated `ReceiptPage` interface to include `thumbnailSignedUrl`
  - Modified thumbnail rendering to use signed URLs
  - All thumbnails now display correctly in the page thumbnail strip

**User Experience Improvements**
- **Removed Success Alert:** Multi-page uploads now complete silently without popup
- **Silent Completion:** Receipts list refreshes automatically to show new upload
- **Better UX:** Users see the completed upload immediately without interruption

### 🔍 Enhanced Logging

#### **Comprehensive Multi-Page Upload Logging**
Added detailed logging throughout the entire multi-page receipt upload process.

**Upload Flow Logging (12+ log points):**

## 🔐 Version 0.5.4 - "MFA Admin Reset Fix" (2025-10-11)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### **Admin MFA Reset - Database Function Approach**
Fixed critical issue with admin emergency MFA reset functionality.

**The Problem:**
- Supabase auth-js `deleteFactor()` method was throwing UUID validation errors
- Edge function couldn't reliably reset user MFA using the Auth API
- Users locked out of MFA couldn't be rescued by admins

**The Solution:**
- Created `admin_reset_user_mfa()` database function that directly manipulates auth tables
- Bypasses problematic auth-js API entirely
- More reliable and faster (single RPC call vs multiple API calls)
- Better error handling and security validation

**Implementation:**
- Direct SQL operations on `auth.mfa_factors` table
- Validates admin permissions before execution
- Updates all related tables (profiles, recovery_codes)
- Complete audit logging to both `audit_logs` and `system_logs`
- Returns success status and factors removed count

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works reliably without UUID validation errors
- ✅ Faster execution (one database call vs multiple API calls)
- ✅ Better error messages and debugging
- ✅ All security checks still in place
- ✅ Complete audit trail maintained

**Technical Details:**
- Migration: `20251011032954_add_admin_reset_mfa_function.sql`
- Database Function: `admin_reset_user_mfa(target_user_id, admin_user_id, reset_reason)`
- Client: `src/lib/adminService.ts` updated to call database function directly
- Edge Function: `admin-user-management` simplified to use database function

### 🔒 Security
- Admin permissions verified by database function
- All MFA reset operations logged with reason tracking
- Service-level access maintained through SECURITY DEFINER function
- Complete audit trail for compliance

### 📊 Impact
- Admin Operations: More reliable MFA management
